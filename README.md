# Collagen alpha 3(VI) Chain Structural Analysis and Prediction 🧬🔬

## Overview

This repository contains the results of a comprehensive structural bioinformatics analysis performed on the **Collagen alpha 3(VI) chain** domain (based on PDB ID **1KTH**). The project utilizes multiple computational platforms to predict the protein's 3D structure and verify its fundamental secondary structure elements (SSEs).

### Analysis Goals
1.  Generate high-confidence **Homology Models** using different threading and modeling tools (SWISS-MODEL and Phyre2).
2.  Predict the **Secondary Structure** composition (alpha helix, beta strand, coil) using the GOR4 method.
3.  Store input sequences, 3D model files, and alignment visualization for cross-validation and study.

## Structural and Prediction Insights

### 1. Predicted Secondary Structure (GOR4)
The GOR4 analysis provides a statistical breakdown of the secondary structure elements (SSEs) for the input sequence:

| SSE Type | Percentage | Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha helix (Hh)** | **0.00%** | **No significant $\alpha$-helix content** predicted. |
| **Extended strand (Ee)** | **34.48%** | Significant **$\beta$-strand** content. |
| **Random coil (Cc)** | **65.52%** | High percentage of flexible loops and turns. |
*This composition (high $\beta$-strand, no $\alpha$-helix) suggests the domain adopts a highly structured $\beta$-sheet fold, which contrasts with the canonical triple helix of full collagen.*

### 2. Tertiary Structure Modeling
* **High Confidence:** Both the SWISS-MODEL and Phyre2 predictions exhibit **high confidence** (as confirmed by the model quality and visualization reports), leveraging templates that share high sequence identity with the target.
* **Cross-Validation:** The two independently generated PDB models (`model_01.pdb` and `Phyre 2 1KTH...pdb`) can be overlaid using the `ALINED.pse` file to visually confirm the consistency of the predicted global fold.
